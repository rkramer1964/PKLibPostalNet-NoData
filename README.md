# PKLibPostalNet

# Purpose

This is a personal nuget package for LibPostalNet, without data files
It supports both windows and linux.

You will need to download the data files from:

https://github.com/rkramer1964/PKLibPostalNetData/releases/download/1.0.0/libpostal.zip and decompress them into c:\libpostal

Windows users should be able to use 7-zip for this.

**Users of this package WILL need to reset the libpostal data directory at runtime.  See the [LibPostalNet](https://github.com/mapo80/LibPostalNet) console demonstration
program for how to do this. (snippet below)**

```
                libpostal.LibpostalSetupDatadir(dataPath);
                libpostal.LibpostalSetupParserDatadir(dataPath);
                libpostal.LibpostalSetupLanguageClassifierDatadir(dataPath);

```

# How it was built

## Windows
See the [LibPostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) project to set up the environment.
Then for the library build:

```
git clone https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal
cd libpostal
cp -rf windows/* ./
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --datadir=/c --disable-sse2
make -j4
make install
```

There were issues reported with SSE, so I disabled it.

## Linux

See the [LibPostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal) project to set up the environment.
Then for the library build:

```
git clone https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal
cd libpostal
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --datadir=`pwd`/libpostal_data --disable-sse2
make -j4
make install
```

**This has my personal build folder on my workstation in the datadir - you WILL need to set the data dir at runtime**
There were issues reported with SSE, so I disabled it.
